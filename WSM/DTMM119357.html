                  and can produce high temperature gases (up to 2500°C). If the gas generator breaks, wear protective equipment (such as protective
                  clothing, protective gloves, goggles) all over the body to deal with the overspill.

               <p class="p">Fluororubber is a kind of fluoroelastomer, as fluorine-contained synthetic rubber.</p>  
               
               <p class="p">The fluororubber is very safe to use under normal conditions. However, if exposed to temperatures above 400°C, the material
                  will not burn but will decompose, and one of the substances produced is hydrofluoric acid. The hydrofluoric acid is highly
                  corrosive and can be absorbed directly into the body by contacting.
               </p>  
               
               <p class="p">O-ring, seal, or gasket, etc., which are exposed to high temperatures, will char or turn to a black and sticky substance.
                  Do not touch them or the objects to which they are attached under any circumstances.
               </p>  
               
               <p class="p">Consultation should be made first to determine whether fluororubber or other fluoroelastomer are contained in the affected
                  O-ring, seal or gasket. If there is uncertainty, be careful, because the material of such parts is likely to be fluororubber
                  or other fluoroelastomer.
               </p>  
               
               <p class="p">If fluororubber or other fluoroelastomer have been exposed to high temperatures, areas likely to be affected should be carefully
                  cleaned before work commences. Disposable hazardous protective plastic gloves should always be worn,&nbsp;the acids should be neutralized
                  with steel balls and limewater (with sodium hydroxide) before disposing of decomposed fluororubber&nbsp;residues and final cleaning
                  of the area,&nbsp;the affected area should be cleaned with clean water,&nbsp;and discarded plastic gloves should be disposed with care.

               <p class="p">Soldering tin is a mixture of metals that have a lower melting point than structural metals (usually lead and tin). If a gas-air
                  flame is used to heat the soldering tin, the use of soldering tin usually does not produce toxic plumes. Do not use acetylene-oxygen
                  flame to heat the soldering tin, because the temperature is too high and lead gas is easily generated, which will cause poisoning
                  if inhaled by the human body.

               <p class="p">The use of any flame on a grease-coated soldering tin may produce certain gases.&nbsp;Inhalation of these gases should be avoided.</p>  
               
               <p class="p">Care should be taken when removing excess soldering tin to avoid inhaling fine lead dust. Use respiratory protective equipment
