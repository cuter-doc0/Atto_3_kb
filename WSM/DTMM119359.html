                              will be produced by electrolysis. Keep away from fire source and well ventilated. Never wear any metal ornaments to avoid
                              sparks. Avoid static electricity in dry environment. Spraying water is acceptable. After being placed in 3.6% salt water for
                              12h, ensure the module voltage is lower than 1/2 of the nominal voltage. Dry the modules with an air gun. And then move them
                              to the high-risk battery storage area.
